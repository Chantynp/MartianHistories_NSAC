# The Martian's Show
This is the reflect of the work of "Los Tiburones", we made this project with the purpose of create a tool able to teach kids about the space weather.

# WebPage
There you can watch the interactive video.

We used a Google Docs document to create the script.

# More About the Project
## WHY
This way to solve the challenge comes from the Netflix interactive series that gave me (Santiago) the idea to create a similar video to teach children how does the space weather work. We investigated how can we do that and here we are, doing this beautiful and useful project where we are doing our best.
## WHAT AND HOW
There is "The Martian's Show" an interactive video initiative where we merge the H5P software to create interactive videos, and the web clouding from GitHub Pages. With this tool we be able to create an HTML code which save the interactive video and allow user to watch it.
## BENEFITS
Doing this using interactives video gave us the possibility to think about all the way that we can approach to the challenge, a children can enjoy the video being a human in the Earth, another children can love looking how does a solar flare cross the Space, so, why shouldn't us do all of them?.
## IMPACT
We are working on interactive videos that can teach children about science, doing an enjoyable experience that spark interest in STEM sciences.
## TOOLS
We used:
- Google Docs for writing story.
- LucidChart for the diagram of story.
- Canva for presentation.
- Canva AI for images.
- VN editor for videos.
- H5P for make a video interactable.
- GitHub Pages for web hosting.
- Visual Studio Code for coding the website.
- Nasa.gov for data, definitions and recourses.
## CREATIVITY
We love teaching so our project is focus on giving children a good experience than can connect atractive images and NASA data. We believe that this project is absolutely unique, we created a scientific and enjoyable story that can make that information accessible for kids.
## FACTORS 
We considered:
+ Story, how the stories will connect with each other.
+ The difference perspectives that there are about the Space Weather.
+ How to do an interesting story than can be funny to children and having enough scientific rigor.
+ The possibilities of this initiative.
